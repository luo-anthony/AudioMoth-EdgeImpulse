# AudioMoth-EdgeImpulse

### *Currently under development* ###

A modified version of the [AudioMoth standard firmware](https://github.com/OpenAcousticDevices/AudioMoth-Project). This software performs live classification of samples using a neural network from Edge Impulse and saves audio clips containing a specific sound.

Based off of [SmartMoth](https://github.com/leocorne/AudioMoth-Project) by [Leo](https://github.com/leocorne).
